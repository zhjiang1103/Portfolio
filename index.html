        I have always had a passion for technology and problem-solving. While studying Math at UCLA, I
        had the opportunity to work on several projects, both individually and in teams, where I practiced my
        technical
        skills and learned how to collaborate effectively with others.
        After graduation, I worked as a special education teacher, where I gained experience in working with diverse
        groups of individuals and developing creative solutions to help students with disabilities succeed. While
        working with those students, I saw the transformative power of learning-assistant technology devices. This
        experience inspired me to pursue a career as a software developer, with a focus on programming and
        Artificial
        Intelligence, so that I could contribute to the development of educational technology.
