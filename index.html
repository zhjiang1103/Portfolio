    font-size: 18px;">I have always had a passion for technology and problem-solving. While studying Math at UCLA, I had the opportunity to work on several projects, both individually and in teams, where I practiced my technical skills and learned how to collaborate effectively with others.
After graduation, I worked as a special education teacher, where I gained experience in working with diverse groups of individuals and developing creative solutions to help students with disabilities succeed. While working with those students, I saw the transformative power of learning-assistant technology devices. This experience inspired me to pursue a career as a software developer, with a focus on programming and Artificial Intelligence, so that I could contribute to the development of educational technology.
