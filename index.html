    <section class="right">
        <p>I have always had a passion for technology and problem-solving. While studying Math at UCLA, I had the opportunity to work on several projects, both individually and in teams, where I practiced my technical skills and learned how to collaborate effectively with others.
            After graduation, I worked as a special education teacher, where I gained experience in working with diverse groups of individuals and developing creative solutions to help students with disabilities succeed. While working with those students, I saw the transformative power of learning-assistant technology devices. This experience inspired me to pursue a career as a software developer.
